Chicago has long been criticized for its high crime rate. However, when we broke down the total number of crime in Chicago to the communities, we found out a striking disparity among communities.
Except Montclaire, the next top five communites have an average of 11,850.6 crimes per year, comparing to 656.5 in the lowest five communities on average.

<p>
Among all the seventy-seven communties, Monclaire appears to be an outlier, enjoying a number of crime per year almost twice as large as the second-ranked community, and about 67 occurrence of crime per day.
</p>
<p>
On the Wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montclare,_Chicago">Montcliar, Chicago</a>, the median household income is $6,238 lower than the average level in Chicago, and 24.4% of the residents there earned less than $25,000 per year. The unemployment rate is 12.3%.
</p>
<p>
We suspect that the demographic features of the community could partially explain the extreme high amount of crime in the area. And we would like to systematically examine the relationship between the socioecomonic indicators and the number of crime at the community-level.
