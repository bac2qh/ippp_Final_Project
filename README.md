# So this is our final project's repo, Enjoy!

### Repo's layout

There are four important folders in this repo. data folder stores
all supporting data; output folder stores all outputs, including maps and plots;
source_code folder is the Jupyter Notebook codes showing both our final results
and the process of our work; finally webpage folder stores our html files.

### Reserch Topic

Our topic is "The relationship between Socioeconomics indicators and Number of
Crimes in Chicago area". The flow of our research can be described as below:

Collecting data => Processing data => plotting data => analyzing data

#### For the collecting data part
we mostly used "Chicago Data Portal". We started off downloading 1.5 GB worth of
data but finally managed to use the portal' API. Saved us tons of time and makes
it easier for others to run our code.

#### Processing data
We used merge and join in pandas multiple times throughout the whole project.
Mask was also a very important part of data processing.
